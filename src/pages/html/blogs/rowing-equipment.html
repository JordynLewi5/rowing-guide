                        <h3>Sculling Oars</h3>
                        <p>Sculling oars are a pair of oars used in the rowing technique known as sculling. Each oar is typically held by a rower in each hand, and they are used to propel the boat forward by sculling the oars back and forth in the water.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Sweeping Oars</h3>
                        <p>Sweeping oars are single oars used in the rowing technique known as sweeping. In sweeping, each rower holds a single oar with both hands and rows on one side of the boat. The rowers work together to create a synchronized rowing motion.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Sculling Riggers</h3>
                        <p>Sculling riggers are the metal arms that hold the oarlocks and connect the sculling oars to the boat. They are designed specifically for sculling oars and are positioned on both sides of the rowing shell.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Sweep Riggers</h3>
                        <p>Sweep riggers are similar to sculling riggers, but they are designed for sweeping oars. They also consist of metal arms that hold the oarlocks and connect the sweeping oars to the boat. Sweep riggers are typically positioned on one side of the rowing shell.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Oarlocks</h3>
                        <p>Oarlocks, also known as rowlocks, are the mechanical components that secure the oars to the riggers. They allow the oars to pivot freely during the rowing stroke, enabling the rower to apply power to the water and propel the boat forward.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Foot Stretchers</h3>
                        <p>Foot stretchers are adjustable footrests located in the rowing shell. They provide a stable platform for the rower's feet and allow the rower to generate power by pushing against them during the leg drive portion of the rowing stroke.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Foot Plates</h3>
                        <p>Foot plates are the surfaces or platforms attached to the foot stretchers where the rower's feet are placed. They provide a solid surface for the rower's feet and are often adjustable to accommodate different foot sizes.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Shoes</h3>
                        <p>Rowing shoes are specialized footwear that are attached to the foot plates. They provide grip and support to the rower's feet, allowing them to transfer power effectively to the oars and maintain stability during the rowing stroke.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Foot Stretcher Tracks</h3>
                        <p>Foot stretcher tracks are the rails on which the foot stretchers slide forward and backward. They allow rowers to adjust the position of the foot stretchers and customize their leg length and reach in the rowing shell.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Seat</h3>
                        <p>The seat is a sliding platform mounted on wheels within the rowing shell. It allows the rower to move back and forth during the rowing stroke, engaging the leg muscles and facilitating a smooth and efficient rowing motion.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Seat Tracks</h3>
                        <p>Seat tracks are the rails on which the seat slides along within the rowing shell. They provide a smooth and controlled motion for the seat, allowing the rower to adjust their seating position and find the optimal position for power and comfort.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Bow Ball</h3>
                        <p>The bow ball is a protective rubber ball attached to the bow (front) of the rowing shell. It serves as a cushioning device and helps prevent damage in case of collisions or contact with other objects.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Slings</h3>
                        <p>Boat slings are supports used to lift and store rowing shells safely. They are typically made of straps or slings that cradle the hull of the rowing shell, allowing it to be lifted and stored without causing any damage.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Lowboys</h3>
                        <p>Lowboys are supports used to store rowing shells on the ground or in boat houses. They typically consist of a sturdy framework or structure that provides stability and security for the boat. Boat stands help protect the hull of the rowing shell and keep it elevated off the ground, minimizing the risk of damage and allowing for easy access and maintenance.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Boat Straps</h3>
                        <p>Boat straps are straps or tie-downs used to secure rowing shells or boats during transportation or storage. They are typically made of strong and durable materials such as nylon or polyester webbing. Boat straps have adjustable buckles or fasteners that allow for easy tightening and loosening.</p>
