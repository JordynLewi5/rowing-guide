                            <p>The single in rowing refers to a specific type of rowing boat designed for a single rower. It is also commonly known as a "single scull."</p>
                            <p>In a single scull, the rower sits in a narrow, long shell with a sliding seat and uses two oar, one in each hand. This rowing boat is built to be stable and streamlined to enable efficient rowing by a single person.</p>
                            <p>The rower faces toward the stern (rear) of the boat and propels the boat forward by applying force to the oar through a series of coordinated movements. The rower uses their legs, core, and upper body to generate power and transfer it to the oar, which are placed in the water.</p>
                            <p>The single scull provides a challenging rowing experience as the rower must maintain balance and control the boat while executing the rowing stroke. It requires a combination of technique, strength, and endurance to achieve efficient and effective rowing.</p>
                            <p>Singles are commonly used for both recreational rowing and competitive rowing. In competitive rowing, single sculling races are often held, testing the rower's speed, agility, and racing strategy.</p>
                            <p>Rowing in a single scull offers a unique connection to the water, allowing the rower to experience the tranquility and beauty of rowing alone, with complete control over the boat's movements. It requires focus, discipline, and mastery of the rowing stroke to achieve optimal performance in this individual rowing discipline.</p>

                            <p>The double in rowing refers to a specific type of rowing boat designed for two rowers. It is also commonly known as a "double scull."</p>
                            <p>In a double scull, two rowers sit side by side in a narrow, long shell with sliding seats and each rower uses two oar, one in each hand. The boat is built to be stable and streamlined to enable efficient rowing by the two rowers working in tandem.</p>
                            <p>The rowers face toward the stern (rear) of the boat and synchronize their movements to propel the boat forward. They coordinate their leg drive, core engagement, and upper body strength to generate power and transfer it to the oar, which are placed in the water.</p>
                            <p>The double scull requires excellent teamwork, coordination, and communication between the rowers. They must row in sync, maintaining a harmonious rhythm and balance to achieve maximum efficiency and speed.</p>
                            <p>Doubles are commonly used in both recreational rowing and competitive rowing. In competitive rowing, double sculling races are popular, challenging the rowers' skills, endurance, and tactical decision-making.</p>
                            <p>Rowing in a double scull offers a shared experience on the water, allowing the rowers to work together, complementing each other's strengths and pushing each other to achieve their best performance. It requires trust, cooperation, and a deep understanding of each other's rowing technique to excel in this team-oriented rowing discipline.</p>

                            <p>The quad is a specific type of rowing shell that is designed to be rowed by a crew of four rowers.</p>
                            <p>The quad shell consists of four rowing positions, with each rower equipped with a pair of oar. The rowers sit in a line facing the stern of the boat, with each rower controlling two oar. The oar are connected to the boat via riggers, which are attached to the sides of the boat.</p>
                            <p>The boat itself is long and narrow, usually made of lightweight materials such as carbon fiber or fiberglass. This construction allows the quad to be fast and maneuverable in the water. The hull of the boat is designed to minimize drag and maximize efficiency, enabling the rowers to propel the boat forward with each stroke.</p>
                            <p>In terms of rowing technique, the quad requires coordination and synchronization among the rowers. The rowers must work together to achieve precise timing and balance in order to maximize the boat's speed and efficiency. The stroke sequence typically involves an alternating pattern of rowers, with one rower starting the stroke followed by the others in sequence.</p>
                            <p>Quads are often used in competitive rowing events, ranging from local regattas to international championships. They are favored for their speed and versatility, making them suitable for various racing distances, from short sprints to longer endurance races. The quad is also a popular choice for recreational rowing, allowing a group of friends or teammates to enjoy the sport together.</p>
